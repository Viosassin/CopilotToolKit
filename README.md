# Project Motivation 🚀
Meeseeks is an innovative AI assistant built on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) architecture. It tackles complex problems by breaking them down into atomic, reproducible tasks, each handled by autonomous agents powered by LLMs. This approach, combined with semantic caching, significantly enhances efficiency and reduces LLM calls. It is also tested to work with OpenAI-compatible endpoints [`[*]`](https://github.com/bearlike/Personal-Assistant/wiki/Additional-Resources). Meeseeks can also call different endpoints for different tools.
